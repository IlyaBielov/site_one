      <h1>Asphalt 9: Legends</h1>
      <p><span class="asphalt">Asphalt 9: Legends</span> is a 2018 racing video game, developed by Gameloft Barcelona
        and published by Gameloft. It is the ninth main installment in the Asphalt series. It was released on 25 July
        2018. The graphics have been significantly improved compared to its 2013 predecessor, Asphalt 8: Airborne. It
        uses the Bullet physics engine. It also has more features, such as new prestigious cars, new navigation
        systems, new events, and "nitro shockwave," which is a recurring feature from Asphalt 6: Adrenaline and Asphalt
        7: Heat.</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>The gameplay in Asphalt 9 is similar to Asphalt 8: Airborne, with noticeable differences in graphics and
        design. There are 48 cars for players to collect, all of which are extremely prestigious. Just like in the
        previous games, there are five classes: D, C, B, A, and S. All cars in the game now require "blueprints" to
        unlock and level up. To add on, a new car editor is in the game. There are also "clubs," where you can make a
        community of players, and achieve rewards.</p>

      <p>The game features "nitro shockwave", which was a feature from Asphalt 6: Adrenaline and Asphalt 7: Heat, but
        was not implemented in Asphalt 8. When the player taps twice on the Nitro button, a purple pulse will be sent
        out. On mobile, Asphalt 9 has three control options, "Tilt to Steer," "Tap to Steer," and the brand new "Touch
        Drive" mode. Touch Drive is similar to the controls from endless runner games, where you swipe to change paths
        or actions. On Windows 10 devices, Touch Drive and manual controls can be used with the keyboard; or with
        touch, if the device has a touchscreen and an accelerometer.</p>

      <p>In the game, there is "Career Mode" and "Multiplayer Mode." Career Mode, which is a recurring feature from its
        predecessors, consists of five "chapters." Each chapter has many seasons where you are prompted to race.
        Multiplayer Mode, also a recurring feature, is where you can race with other players. In multiplayer, there is
        a ranking system, with consists of “Bronze”, “Silver”, “Gold”, “Platinum” and “Legend”.</p>

      <p>There are multiple race modes in Asphalt 9. The "classic" race mode from previous games has returned. Along
        with this, new race modes are in the game, such as "Time Attack," when the vehicle has to cross the finish line
        before time runs out; and "Hunted," when the vehicle has to race against police cars, in a car chase.</p>

      <p>The game features new race tracks in Rome, Cairo, the Himalayas, the U.S. Midwest, and Scotland. It also
        brings back two tracks from previous games, which are San Francisco and Shanghai.</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>The game was developed by Gameloft's Barcelona Studio which also made Asphalt 6: Adrenaline, Asphalt 8:
        Airborne, and co-developed Asphalt Xtreme with Gameloft Madrid. The game uses the Bullet physics engine, and
        the Jet Engine game engine.</p>

      <p>Continuing the tradition from Asphalt 8, the game features licensed soundtracks.</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The first rumors of Asphalt 9: Legends began back in 2016, with Gameloft posting pictures on Twitter, showing
        Gameloft Barcelona making a map that had not been seen in Asphalt 8: Airborne. The game was scheduled to be
        released in summer of 2017 according to Gameloft's press release, and the name was going to be Asphalt 9:
        Shockwave.</p>

      <p>In March 2018, Gameloft was doing a live Q&A with one of their community managers at Gameloft London, where he
        responded to questions about Asphalt 9, and said that he was not allowed to comment on the future of the
        Asphalt series. Four days later, however, a trailer was revealed for Asphalt 9.</p>

      <p>The game was first released for iOS as a soft launch on 26 February 2018 in the Philippines, then in Thailand
        on 22 March 2018. It was later released for Android as a soft launch, on 17 May 2018 in the Philippines. </p>

      <p>Pre-registration for Asphalt 9 began on 29 June 2018. Around the same time, people could pre-register the game
        on the Google Play Store.</p>

      <p>On 24 July 2018, Gameloft announced the game's release date, 26 July 2018, on a Facebook and YouTube
        livestream. However, the game released a day earlier than planned.</p>

      <p>On 25 July 2018, the game released worldwide. The game reached 4 million downloads across all platforms in
        less than a week.</p>
